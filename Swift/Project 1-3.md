## What I learned

* Table views using ```UITableView```. These are used everywhere in iOS, and are one of the most important components on the entire platform.
* Image views using ```UIImageView```, as well as the data inside them, ```UIImage```. Remember: a ```UIImage``` contains the pixels, but a ```UIImageView``` displays them – i.e., positions and sizes them. You also saw how iOS handles retina and retina HD screens using @2x and @3x filenames.
* Buttons using ```UIButton```. These don’t have any special design in iOS by default – they just look like labels, really. But they do respond when tapped, so you can take some action.
* View controllers using ```UIViewController```. These give you all the fundamental display technology required to show one screen, including things like rotation and multi-tasking on iPad.
* System alerts using ```UIAlertController```. We used this to show a score in project 2, but it’s helpful for any time you need the user to confirm something or make a choice.
* Navigation bar buttons using ```UIBarButtonItem```. We used the built-in action icon, but there are lots of others to choose from, and you can use your own custom text if you prefer.
* Colors using ```UIColor```, which we used to outline the flags with a black border. There are lots of built-in system colors to choose from, but you can also create your own.
* Sharing content to Facebook and Twitter using ```UIActivityViewController```. This same class also handles printing, saving images to the photo library, and more.
